# Specifying an image for Facebook and Twitter sharing

You can specify which image you want to use as the default poster image when a page is shared using Facebook or Twitter.

By default a page will try and select a suitable image to use when it is shared. However, sometimes this might not be suitable. In such cases you can override the automatic choice by manually adding an image.

To do this, first edit a page, then click the “[tv: poster_image_tab_name]” tab at the top. Then, Click Insert > Images and drag an image into the editing area. 

<span class="highlight">**Important:** Make sure you only use images that you've added elsewhere on your visible page. A valid poster image must also be visible on the page. </span>
