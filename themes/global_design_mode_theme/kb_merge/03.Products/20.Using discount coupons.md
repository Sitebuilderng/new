# Using discount coupons

You can add coupon codes that result in a discount being applied to your customer's order. 

To add a coupon go to Website Settings > Coupon codes. Tick the 'Enable coupon codes in checkout' to enable the feature. 

You'll see fields for up to 5 different discounts. Each discount can have multiple codes entered, just add them separated by commas. 

For each discount, enter a percentage reduction for the discount. 

You can optionally restrict the codes to only apply to products that have a certain product category applied to them by entering the name of one or more categories (separated by commas) in the 'restrict to product categories' field. This code wil then only reduce the price of products in the given categories. Products without the category or in other categories will not be reduced. 

You can enter the same code in more than one discount. If each discount applies to products in different categories, this lets the same discount code apply a different discount to different products in the customer's cart.
