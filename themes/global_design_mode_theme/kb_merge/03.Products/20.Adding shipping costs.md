# Adding shipping costs

Your website includes a flexible system to define various shipping rates. 

Click 'Website Settings' from the Welcome Screen then click 'Shipping' in the menu. 

To enable shipping options on your website, tick the 'Enable shipping costs at checkout' item. You can then enter text to identify the section in the checkout to your customers in the 'Shipping Name' field. For example, you could choose to enter 'Postage and packaging' or 'Shipping and handling' or another phrase more suitable for your products and audience. 

You'll then see a long list of fields. The system lets you populate up 10 different shipping 'options' in 5 'tiers'.

**What are 'options'?**

'Options' are the different shipping options that your customer can choose on the checkout page. These are typically used for things like different levels of shipping service, for example 'Economy' or 'Next day'. As such, each option has its own price and name. 

**What are 'tiers'?**

'Tiers' are collections of options that are used based on a total order value. For example, you might want to charge less for shipping on larger orders. In this case, you'd add a new tier of options with the lower prices. You don't actually need to keep the same options in each tier so you could create different sets of shipping options based on the user's basket total.

## Setting your values

Each option has its own field and its named using a format like 'Shipping tier 1 option 1', 'Shipping tier 1 option 2' and so on. You need to enter a visible name for the option as well as the price. You can enter 0 for free options.

As you work down the list, you'll see an option to enable a new tier and set a price threshold for that tier. 

Please note, if you have added per-product shipping costs, these will be added to the shipping cost you specify here. If you enter 0 to allow a free shipping option, this will result any per-product shipping amounts being removed. To allow only the per-product shipping amounts to be in use, simply don't enable the 'Website Settings'  > 'Enable shipping costs in checkout' option.

## Setting coupons codes to run 'free shipping' offers

Each shipping option has an optional code that you can populate to create a coupon code that would result in that shipping option becoming free when the code is entered. You can use the same code in multiple options. Please note, these coupons are multi-use and do not expire. You don't need to create one per customer. 

If your have added per-product shipping fees and a user enters a code to trigger free shipping, the per-product fees will also be removed. 

## Setting tax eligibility based on selected option

You might want to add shipping options that correspond to different shipping regions for your customers. As a result of this you might not want to add sales tax to each orders once a certain shipping region is selected. You can simply untick the 'Charge sales tax' box to enable this.
