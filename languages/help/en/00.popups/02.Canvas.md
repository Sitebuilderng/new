# Canvas

The Canvas is the area of the CMS (Content Management System) where you work with content. Unlike other systems, you don't directly edit the content of your webpage. This system provides a side by side approach where you have a canvas on the left, and a live preview of the website on the right. Smaller devices will have a 'Preview' button instead of showing the side by side layout.
