# Working with lists

Most of the areas of the CMS operate in a very similar way. That is, you are usually working with items of some kind that appear in a list.

## Adding items

At the top left of the view you'll see a button that you can click to add a new item of the current type. For example, when working in Webpages, the button will read 'New webpage'. 

After clicking the button, you'll see a new placeholder item added to the list. You can now type the name of the item. Then hit return to add the new item. 

## Selecting items

Single click an item to select it. This prepares it for having its properties changes using the toolbar. Double click an item (even if it isn't selected) or hit return on your keyboard to perform the default action for the item, as indicated by the yellow button in the toolbar. 

You can select more than one item at a time so speed up your workflow. CMD+Click (Mac) or CTRL+Click (Windows) will add or remove the clicke item for a selection. This is useful for selecting specific items that aren't next to each other. 

You can select a batch of consecutive items using Shift+Click. For example, click the first item, then hold down Shift and click the last item. All the items in between will be selected as well. 

### Selecting with your keyboard

Your keyboard can also be used to quickly create a selection. Use the up/down arrow keys to select the first or last item in the list. Continue going up or down to change the selection to the next or previous item. If you hold down Shift while you use the up/down arrow keys you will add too or remove from a batch selection. 

## Change properties for one or more items

All views in the [CMS](#/popups/cms/) support multi-selection and have a 'toolbar' that runs down the right side of the list. You can click items in your list to select them. Once you have one or more items selected, you can use the menus, checkboxes and actions in the toolbar to make changes to your selection. Changes occur in real time - there is no need to publish toolbar changes. 


## Removing items

You can remove items from a list by selecting the items you want to remove then clicking the 'Delete' button in the toolbar or hitting backspace. 

## Filtering and searching your list

Some views in the CMS allow the list to be filtered by one or more properties. For example, Webpages can be filtered by language. When you add a new item to a filtered view, the new item will inherit the filtered property so the new items appears in the list straight away. The filter tool is found on the right, above the the toolbar. You can also click the magnifying glass icon to search your list by keyword. 

## Reordering your items

Some lists maintain an 'order' of the items that you can change. Simply drag and drop to re-order your items.
