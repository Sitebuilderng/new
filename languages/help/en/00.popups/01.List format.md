# List format

Most of the data you work with in the CMS uses the same basic editing system. That is, your content is shown in a powerful multi-select capable list interface.

Your items are shown in the main area and a toolbar is shown on the right of them. When you change the tools in the right toolbar, the properties of your selected items are changed. 

The nice thing about this list format is that the same principles apply when working with content on pages as well as when organising other kinds of content in different areas of the system. It is consistent throughout.

## Selecting items 

In this video you can see how a single click selects an item. Once an item is selected, properties in the toolbar can be changed.

## Selecting multiple items

You can use ⌘+Click (Mac) or ⊞+Click (Windows) to select more than one item in your list. This method can be used to remove items from a selection in the same way.

## End-to-end selection

You can select a long range of items by holding down Shift when clicking the second item.

## Sorting

Some lists have a definable order. You can change the order of items by dragging and dropping. You'll see a blue target line indicating where the item will be moved to. Just click and drag to sort. You can also click and drag a multi-selection to move more than one item to a new position in one go.
