# Page speed is slow

There are a few common things to check when pages are loading slowly. There are two main controls for caching sites in the system. One is in the Hub level and one is on a page-by-page level.


## Hub-level caching option


To check the Hub option, click the 'Settings' button next to the site in the Hub then scroll down to find the 'Disable page caching' checkbox. This shouldn't be checked on live sites. 

Once you untick this box, the system will load pages slowly once more to generate the caches and then page speed should increase. 

### Omitting level 4 pages to improve performance

On sites that have very long lists of fourth level pages, you can also exclude them from the navigation menus to improve performance. Simply tick the 'Omit fourth level pages' option in the Hub Settings for your site to enable this option.

## Page level caching option

Then, edit individual pages in the CMS and click the 'Page' menu and make sure the 'Enable page caching' option is ticked.
