# Restoring a backup of a site

The backup files are stored inside a 'backups' folder within each site's corresponding folder in the main 'sites' folder. 

They are named as follows:

daily-1.sql  
daily-2.sql  
daily-3.sql  
daily-4.sql  
daily-5.sql  
daily-6.sql  
daily-7.sql  
weekly-1.sql  
weekly-2.sql  
weekly-3.sql  
weekly-4.sql  
weekly-5.sql  
monthly-1.sql  
monthly-2.sql  
monthly-3.sql  
monthly-4.sql  
monthly-5.sql  
monthly-6.sql  
monthly-7.sql  
monthly-8.sql  
monthly-9.sql  
monthly-10.sql  
monthly-12.sql  

As a backup gets older, the number increases. i.e daily-2.sql is a backup from 2 days ago, weekly-3 is the backup from 3 weeks ago. Given the interval and cycle the exactly age may vary somewhat. Check the file created time over FTP to check when it was actually created. 

To restore one of these the process is as follows:

Copy the whole folder for the site, and rename it to something that you'll recognise. i.e sites/sitetorestore gets duplicated to sites/restoredsite

Then, move the backup file to sites/restoredsite/db.sql so that the default database ready for importing is based on a historic version. Then, reload the Hub and import the new site for the 'restoredsite' folder. The new site will be a restored version of the original site.
