# Adding password protection to pages

You can choose to prevent normal visitors from being able to access your pages by using the 'Security' feature.

The Access Groups feature lets you create security groups based on a username and password. The same group can be applied to more than one page to allow a logged in user to browse multiple pages without having to sign in again.

## Adding password protection to a page

To require a username and password before a page can be viewed, select the page you want to protect, then click the menu item under 'Security'. Click 'Add access group' then enter a username and password for this group. Click 'Add' to create this group and apply it to your selected pages. You'll be able to choose this from the menu if you want to apply this group to another page in the future.
