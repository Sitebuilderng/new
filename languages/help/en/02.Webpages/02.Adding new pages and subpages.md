# Adding new pages and subpages

You can add new pages that appear in your website's main menu. You can also add pages that are hidden from your menu, or pages that are subpages of other pages. 

## Adding a new webpage to your main menu

Click 'Add new webpage' in the Webpages list. You'll see a blank page appear where you can type the page's name. Hit return on your keyboard to save it. New webpages are set to 'offline' by default to avoid that situation of a blank page appearing your site. 

When you're ready to make your page visible on your website, select it first, then click the 'Status' dropdown menu and change the value to 'Live'.

## Adding a new subpage to a page

You can add a page as a 'subpage' of another page. This means it won't show up in your main navigation menu but it will show up when users hover or click the parent page. 

Select the page you want to add subpages to, then click 'Add subpage'. Once the page has one or more subpages, this button will read 'View / Add Subpages'. 

Enter the name for your subpage and hit enter to confirm. You are now viewing the subpage context for the parent page shown at the top of the list. All other pages are hidden until you drill back up by clicking the 'drill up' button.

## Adding a new page that is hidden from your menus

If you want a page to be hidden from you main menus, dropdown menus and sidebar menus, you can simply tick the 'Hide from menus' option in the toolbar when selecting one or more pages.
