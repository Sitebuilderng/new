# Reverting to an older version of a page

Every time you click 'Publish changed' when [editing a page](#adding-content-in-different-sections-of-your-page) the previous version is archived and can be easily restored if you change your mind. 

To do this, first edit your page, then click 'Page' and then choose a version under the 'Versions' heading. If you make changes to a previous version, that version will become a new draft until you click 'Publish Changes'.
