# Publishing your page

Before your [new page](#adding-new-pages-and-subpages) will appear on your website you need to publish it.

Select your page in the Webpages list then click the menu below 'Status' and select 'Live'. 

If you click 'Publish changes' when [editing a page](#adding-content-in-different-sections-of-your-page) you'll be prompted to publish your page at that stage as well.
