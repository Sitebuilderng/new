# Working with Contact Forms

Start by [editing a page](#webpages-overview).

You can select your new form and then use the tools to configure it.

## Changing the form recipient

Click the Recipient text field and enter one or more email addresses separated by commas. These email addresses will receive the results of the form when a visitor fills out the form. 

## Automatically replying to form submission emails

When you receive a form submission email, you may or may not be able to reply to it directly to reply to the sender. This depends on how the fields in the form are set up. 

Example email headers where there are no 'name' or 'email' fields: (You will not be able to reply to this email)  
From: "example.com Contact Form" <no-reply@example.com>  
Reply-To: NOT SET

Example email headers where there is a 'name' field but not an 'email' field: (You will not be able to reply to this email)  
From: "Steve Jobs (Sent via example.com)" <no-reply@example.com>  
Reply-To: NOT SET

Example email headers where there is an 'email' field but not an email field: (You will be able to reply to this email)  
From: "steve@example.com (Sent via example.com)" <no-reply@example.com>  
Reply-To: <steve@example.com>

Example email headers where there is an 'email' field and a 'name' field (You will be able to reply to this email):  
From: "Steve Jobs (Sent via example.com)" <no-reply@example.com>  
Reply-To: Steve Jobs <steve@example.com>

## Editing the form fields

Click the 'Edit form fields' button to start adding or editing the fields for your form. Fields are the areas that your visitors fill out to send their information to you. 

Add fields by clicking 'Add field', then typing a label for the field. This is shown next to the field to identify it to your visitors. For example, if you want to request your visitors' email address, you could add a field label like this (notice the colon at the end, this is an optional step that can help with the presentation of the form):

*Your Email Address:*

Hit enter to save the new field. You can then set what kind of field to use using the 'Kind' menu. 

### Kinds of field

**Name**  
Use when requesting a the visitor's name. Only use one of these per form. If you need to request other names in a form, simply use 'Short text' for them. This 'Name' field is used to determine the 'reply to' behaviour as detailed above. 

**Email**  
Use when requesting a visitor's email address. As with the Name fields, only use on of these per form. 

**Phone**  
Use when requesting a phone number.

**Date**  
Fields with this type will show a date 'picker' when the visitors clicks in the field. This lets them click a day to enter that day's full date easily. 

**Short text**  
A generic text field that can be used for any short amount of text (this is a single line field).

**Long text**  
A multi-line text field for larger amounts of text. 

**Checkbox**  
A field that lets the visitor click to toggle an item on or off. One checkbox per field. 

**Radio buttons**  
A field type that has multiple choices. After choosing this type, click 'Edit field choices' to add or edit the different options that will show in the list of options.  Only one item can be selected but all choices will be shown on the page. 

**Dropdown menu**  
A field type that has multiple choices. After choosing this type, click 'Edit field choices' to add or edit the different options that will show in the dropdown menu.  Only one item can be selected and the menu will need to be clicked to display available choices. 

**Heading**  
Not technically a field. Users can't add their own information here. Use this field kind to show a heading in your form at this location.

**Text**  
Not technically a field. Users can't add their own information here. Use this field kind to show some text in your form at this location.

**New Row**  
Not technically a field. Users can't add their own information here. Use this field kind to start a new row when using the 'width' values to build a form in multiple columns. There is no need to add any text to the label for these fields.

**Horizontal Rule**
Add a visible horizontal line between fields to add separation between sections of your form.

**File**
Allow users to upload a file with their contact form. You can add multiple file upload fields to a form, or encourage users to send a zipped file for multiple files. When you receive an email notification with your form submission data, you'll see a link that you can click to download the file. 


### Building a form in multiple columns using the 'width' tool

You can specify the width of a field to allow the form to be built using multiple columns. A single form can be made up of different rows each containing different numbers of columns. You can choose between 25, 50, 75 and 100% widths. For example if you set four consecutive fields to 25% each, you would have a four column layout in that row. 

### Setting fields to be required

If you tick the 'Required' tickbox, the form won't send until the visitors has filled the field out. 

## Adding your form to your page

Once you've finished adding fields to your form, you can click the back arrow at the top left to go back to the main Contact forms list. Then, you can simply start dragging your form item. The Contact forms list will fade away letting you drop the form on your page in the location you want. You'll then see your form show up in the live preview.
