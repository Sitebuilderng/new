# Adding video to your page

You can upload videos and embed them on your pages using the built in tools in the system. 

Start by editing the page you want to add the video to. Then click Insert > Video. Then click 'Upload new video'. Choose an mp4 video file on your machine and select it to upload. You can then select the new video in the list and click 'Change preview image' to choose your own initial preview image for the video. This will display on the page before the user clicks play. 

Then just drag the video to your page to add it.
