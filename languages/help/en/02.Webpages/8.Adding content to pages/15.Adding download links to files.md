# Adding download links to files

You can easily create links on your website to allow visitors to download files.

First, edit the page you want to add the link to. 

Then, add some text that you want to become the clickable link. 

Select that text and then click 'Link'. Then click 'Choose file'. 

You can then choose a file that you've previously uploaded or you can upload a new one by clicking 'Upload new file'. You can also drag files from your computer desktop to the files list to upload.

Click the file in the list then click then 'Done'. 

You'll then see your original text wrapped in a special 'shortcode' which is required to turn your text into the link.
