# Widgets overview

Widgets work in a similar way as [layout items](#layout-overview) except they usually perform a more complex or specific task. 

When you add a widget to a page it appears and functions in the same way as a Layout item in that it is a selectable item in your [Canvas](#/popup/canvas) and it contains 'editable zones' that you can add content to. 

To add a Widget to your page, edit a page, then click 'Insert' then 'Widgets'. Then drag the widget onto your page in the same way you would for a [layout item](#layout-overview).
