# Using the Invoice widget

The invoice widget is an advanced system that lets you create a persistant, rich formatted page that displays details for an order. 

Your customer can choose to view or print the invoice from their browser and refer to it any time in the future.

These invoices are also visible to you as site administrator when you process the order in Checkout orders using the 'View Invoice' button. 

<span class="pro">Pro tip: You can use your web browser to save the invoice as a PDF which you or your customer can then print or save.</span>

Before you can work with invoices you need to setup your website to sell products, including [creating a Checkout page](#using-the-checkout-widget). 

## Creating your invoice template

You setup your invoice template in a similar way to setting up your Checkout page. First, create a new page that will be used as the Invoice template. You'll want to keep this page hidden from your main menus so tick the 'Hide from menus' option. 

Then, make the page live and edit the page. Then click Insert > Widgets then drag the Invoice widget onto your page. 

At this stage you can then add additional content above or below the widget on the page to build your invoice template. For example, your business address and company registration number. 

You will see the 'No invoice found' where the widget is placed while working with the live preview. This is normal. When a real invoice is displayed, the order line items will be displayed here. 

Once you publish the page, the system will recognise and use this page to display invoices.

## Make sure your customers receive a link to their invoice

By default, the customer won't see the invoice. Only you as admin will see the 'show invoice' links in the 'Checkout orders' area. However, you can send a link to a customer's invoice along with their order received email and/or order dispatched email. 

The 'Order received' and 'Order dispatched' email templates are created using plain text and configured in Website Settings > Checkout orders > Order received template and Order dispatched template. 

When you edit the email templates you'll see there are shortcodes that you can add to add the order data to the emails. One of these shortcodes is {INVOICE_LINK} - this will be used to show a link to the customer's invoice. 

You can decide if you want to show the invoice in the 'order received' email or the 'order dispatched' email just by including the shortcode in the respective template.
