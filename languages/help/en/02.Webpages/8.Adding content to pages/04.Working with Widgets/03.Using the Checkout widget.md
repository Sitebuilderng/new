# Using the Checkout widget

To setup your website to sell products, you need to create a page that will be your Checkout. This can be any top level page but it doesn't need to be visible in your menu. 

Simply edit the page, then click 'Insert' > 'Widgets' and drag the Checkout widget to your page. Click Publish to save the page. 

You can optionally add some further details to this page, for example text explaining how soon you'll dispatch your items etc.

Your website can only have one checkout page. If you add the Checkout widget to another page, it will be removed from any other pages that had it previously. 

## Checkout settings

As well as creating a Checkout page you also need to setup some basic settings before you can start selling products on your website.

## How the Checkout works from your visitorsâ€™ perspective

When you have [added products to your website](#add-products-to-your-pages) your visitors will be able to click 'add to basket' to add them to their order. When they do this, they will be redirected to your Checkout page automatically.
