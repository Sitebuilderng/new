# Using the Sitemap widget

The Sitemap widget lets you show a list of all pages and subpages on your website listed in a nested list.

You would typically add this widget to a single page on your website but you might also add it to the footer of your website if you wanted such a list to display on all pages of your site.

Simply edit the page you want to add the Sitemap to then click Insert > Widgets then drag the Sitemap widget to your page to add it.
