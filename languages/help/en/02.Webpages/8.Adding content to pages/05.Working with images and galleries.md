# Working with images and galleries

## Adding a single image to a page amongst other content

When you edit a page you can easily add a new image to the page and adjust its layout to allow text or other content to flow around it. 

The fastest way to add an image to a page is simply to drag it from your computer desktop to the editor [Canvas](#/popup/canvas). You can even do this with more than one image at once. 

When you do this, the images will be uploaded and stored in the Images storage palette as well as added to that location on your page. If you remove the image from the page, you can add it again by clicking Insert > Images and dragging it to your page. Deleting it from the page itself won't remove it from the Images palette.

## Images storage palette

All your images are stored in the Images storage palette (accessed by clicking Insert > Images or simply directly from the Welcome Screen). This means you can add the same image easily to more than one page without uploading it more than once. 	

When you rename an image in the Images storage palette, it will change the default alt tag value for the next time you add it to a page. It *won't* change the alt tag for any pages that currently have the image added. 

You can change the rotation of the image from the Images palette. Changing this setting *will* update all instances of the image on all pages. 

If you remove an image from the Images palette it will remove it from the whole website. 

### Adding alt tags to images

When you add an image to a page, you can change the alt tag for that image. This is done on a page by page basis and is not centrally based on the image name in the Images palette. This is to allow for more descriptive text for an image in its actual context. 

It's important for accessibility and search engine optimisation that all images on your website have an accurate descriptive caption added in this way.

Once the image is showing on your page, simply double click it to change its 'alt text' value (shown as Description in the CMS). Hit Esc or click away to save the change then Publish to update the live version of the page.

### Adjusting sizing, cropping and alignment  of images

Once you add an image to a page you can decide how that image is displayed on that page by using the toolbar on the left. You can choose different size/crop settings from the 'Image size' menu and different alignment options in 'Image alignment'. These settings only to apply to the instance of this image on the current page. 

### Adding links to images

If you want your image to be a clickable link, you can choose the link destination by double clicking the image after adding it to a page. You'll see the link options just below the alt text/Description field. Hit Esc or click away to save the change then click Publish to make it live on your website. 

### Storage images in categories for organisation

The Images palette has a handy Categories system that lets you maintain collections of images to make it easier to find your images. The Categories sytem can also be used to create galleries - more on this below. 

When you are viewing your Images palette, either after clicking Insert > Images when editing a page or simply after clicking Images from the Welcome Screen, you can select one or more images then click the menu under Categories and choose a category to add the images to. 

If there are no categories listed or you want to create a new one, click 'Manage Categories' and add a new category first. 

Images can be in more than category. 

## Creating a gallery of multiple images

Galleries also use the Images palette which makes it very easy to manage your image assets. 

Galleries are created by choosing an image category that will create the collection of images in the gallery. We'll look at the steps of making a new gallery here. 

### Upload images to the Images palette

Start by uploading a collection of images to your Images palette. Because our intention is to make a gallery out of the images we won't drag the image files to the page editor to upload them. Instead go straight to Images from the welcome screen then click 'Upload new image(s)'. Choose the images on your computer then upload them.

Select the images you've just uploaded then click the Categories menu. Then click 'Quick Add'.

<img src="help.php?img=quick-add.png&amp;halfsize=true" srcset="help.php?img=quick-add.png 2x"/>

Type the name you'd like to use for your new category and tick the "Automatically create a new Gallery to show all images in the category" checkbox. This whole 'Quick Add' process is a shortcut for the following 4 steps:

1. Creating a new category
2. Assigning the selected images to the new category
3. Creating a new Gallery in the Gallery palette
4. Setting the new Gallery to use the new category to display images from

You can of course still perform the steps separately but the Quick Add feature makes it extremely fast. 

If you want to add more images in the future, simply view the Images palette, filter by the category used by your Gallery and then upload new images. 

### Changing gallery image order

The order of the images is specified by dragging and dropping images while the images palette filter is set to the category used by a given gallery.

### Adding a gallery to your page

To add your gallery to a page, edit your page then click Insert > Galleries and drag the gallery to your page.
