# Working with text

After [editing a page](#adding-content-in-different-sections-of-your-page), click anywhere in the [Canvas](#/popup/canvas) to start adding text.

When you see a text line highlighted in blue, you can start typing to add text to that area. 

<img src="help.php?img=blue-highlight.png&amp;halfsize=true" srcset="help.php?img=blue-highlight.png 2x"/>

If you type two new lines while entering text, a new paragraph will automatically be created and selected. 

When you've finished entering new text you can hit Esc to leave the 'text editing' mode. This will turn the highlight colour from blue to grey. 

# Selecting text

When a block of text is highlighted grey or blue, you can make changes to it using the toolbar on the left. For example, to change the text to a Main heading, choose the menu below 'Text format' and select 'Main heading'. 

<img src="help.php?img=toolbar.png&amp;halfsize=true" srcset="help.php?img=toolbar.png 2x"/>

If you click an existing item of text, it will initially place the cursor and enter text editing mode. 

You can hit Esc at any time to dismiss the text editing mode and return to a normal grey selection. You'll then be able to use the keyboard controls to apply changes to formatting or the arrow keys to change the selected item. Backspace will delete the selected item(s).
