# Show data in tables

You can import cell-based data from a spreadsheet into a table for your page. 

1. Edit a page
2. Click Insert
3. Enter the name for your table (just for your reference)
4. Select the new table in the list and click 'Add table data'
5. You can now paste in the CSV data into this field. Most spreadsheet applications let you simply select and copy the cells you want to generate the CSV data so you can simply paste it into this field. 
6. Click Import and then drag the table to your page content area to add it. 

You can also choose how the header rows or columns should be displayed using the Headers menu option.

This example shows the whole process:
