# Add embed codes to your pages

If you want to add a third party item of content to your website that provides you with an embed code in raw HTML, you can use this method to embed it onto your page. 

First edit the page you want to add the embed code to, then click Insert > Embed Codes then click 'Add embed code'. 

<img src="help.php?img=embed_code_1.png&amp;halfsize=true" srcset="help.php?img=embed_code_1.png 2x"/>

Enter a name in a 'Name (not public)' field. This is just used for your reference and won't be seen publicly. 

Then paste in the embed code your third party application has provided into the 'Code (paste code here)' field. Hit Esc to submit and create the new Embed Code. 

You can then drag the new Embed Code onto your page.
