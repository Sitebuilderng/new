# Layout overview

The Layout system is flexible and consistent and allows you to add content in creative ways to dress up your page. 

First [edit a page](#adding-content-in-different-sections-of-your-page). Then, to add a layout item to your page, click Insert, then click 'Layout'. You can then choose which layout item you'd like to add to your page. 

To add it to your page simply start dragging it. The list of Layout items will slide away automatically allowing you to place your selected into onto the Canvas at the location you want. Look out for the blue target line as you drag it and then release when the blue target line is at the location you want to add the layout item.

Once the layout item is on your [Canvas](#/popup/canvas) you'll see the editable zones inside it. You can drag content into these zones to place the content in that area of the layout item. For example, here we have added the 'lorem ipsum' text item into the 'Main Content' area of the 'Content with Sidebar' Layout item.
