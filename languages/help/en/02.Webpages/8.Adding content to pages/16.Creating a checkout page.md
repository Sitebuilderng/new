# Creating a checkout page

When you first setup your website to sell products, you need to create a 'Checkout' page. 

This is done by adding the Checkout Widget to a page. Only one page can have a Checkout Widget applied to it. The page you most recently add the Checkout Widget to will be treated as the Checkout page for your website.

When customers add a product to their basket, they will automatically be redirected to the Checkout page.

First, create and edit a new webpage. Then click Insert > Widgets then drag the 'Checkout' Widget onto your content area.

You can optionally add other content to your checkout page like delivery information as required.

Click Publish to complete the process.
