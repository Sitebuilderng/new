# Save sections of content to re-use on more than one page

You can create sections of content that can contain all the same elements as normal webpages and save them for inclusion on more than one page. These are called Snippets.

The other use for Snippets is that it allows you to nest content like columns or widgets that normally can't be nested. 

Snippets can be created under the Insert menu/Storage like other content elements and can then be shown on any page just by dragging it onto the editing area. You can also add a Snippet into the content of another Snippet. 

It's worth remembering that a Snippet won't show on your website unless the Snippet itself is added to an actual Webpage via the Insert > Snippets menu. You can see this at the end of the video below.

Here's an example showing how a column item can be nested inside a widget with an editable area. Something that isn't possible when working on a single page.
