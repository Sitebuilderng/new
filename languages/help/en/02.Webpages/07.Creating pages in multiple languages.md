# Creating pages in multiple languages

The multi-language system is flexible and simple. Instead of having to provide versions of every page in your site in different languages, you simply designate pages as being in a certain language. When a visitor viewes a page, the main menu will only show other pages in the same language. 

First, select one or more pages in the Webpages view and click the menu item under 'Language'.

## Filtering Webpages by languages

You can choose to view only pages in a certain language to help with finding pages you're working on. Just click the Languages menu item to choose between the languages in use on your site. When you are filtering your pages by a language, new pages will automatically be assigned the same language. This makes it faster to add pages to a certain language version of your site.
