# Organising your articles by categories and tags

You can group your articles to make it easier for your visitors to find your content. There are two main approaches to achieve this. One is using Categories and one is using Tags. Categories are top-down collections that you add articles to. Tags work in a similar way but you can add different tags to articles on an article by article basis. Vistors can then see a 'tag cloud' of all tags as well as being able to view other articles with the same tag as an article they've viewing. 

A visitor might use categories more for ‘browsing’, and tags more for ‘discovering’. 

## Managing categories

From the [Welcome Screen](#/popup/welcome-screen), select Blog Articles. Then select an article and click the 'Categories' menu. You can then click 'Manage Categories' where you can add new categories. Once you've added some categories you can go back and then tick the ones you want to apply to your selected article. 

## Working with tags

You can add tags to your articles by editing an article first, then clicking the Page menu, then Tags. Then enter a list o tags separated by commas.
