# How to add a blog to your website

Before you can start publishing blog articles on your website, you need to decide which of your main menu pages will be your main 'blog index' page. 

Create and Edit the page you want to become your blog index page and then click Insert > Widgets and then drag the Blog widget into the [Canvas](#/popup/canvas). 

Now publish this page. 

Once published, your website will know that all blog entries should show on this page. The blog index page will include features like a date filter, tag filter and category browser tools. You can show or hide these features in Website Settings > Template Settings. You can specify how many articles are shown per page in Website Settings > Blog articles > Articles per page.
