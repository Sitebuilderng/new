# Adding blog articles

Once you've set up your website with a blog index page, you can start adding articles. Each article will have a comment system to let your customers add comments to your articles. This can be disabled in Website Settings > Template Settings. 

From the [Welcome Screen](#/popup/welcome-screen), click Blog Articles. Then, add a new article in the same way you would with a [new webpage](#adding-new-pages-and-subpages), click New Blog Article, type the title of the article then hit return to add it. You can then edit the page and add your content. This process is the same as working with normal webpages except you won't be able to access different template sections and some widgets aren't available.

## Featuring articles

You can use the 'Pinned' feature to keep important articles near the top of your blog index. This works in any area of the blog. For example, if your visitor views all articles in a certain category, Pinned articles in that category will stay in the top area. Simply tick the 'Pinned' checkbox in the toolbar when a blog article is selected.
