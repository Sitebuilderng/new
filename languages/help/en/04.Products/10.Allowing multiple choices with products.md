#  Allowing multiple choices with products

You can add a list of variants for your products, each with its own price and stock values. 

You can add variants to all product types except [Donation](#working-with-donation-products) and [Digital Delivery](#working-with-digital-delivery-products). 

First, create a new product by clicking Products from the Welcome Screen and then clicking 'Add product', type a name for your product and then hit enter to save it. Select the product and click the menu under 'Type'. Then click 'Product has multiple choices'. 

Once you've enabled this option, you can dismis the menu and then click 'Edit product choices'. 

Use the standard [list editing tools](#/popup/working-with-lists) to create your new options. You can set a price and stock level for each option in the toolbar. Please note you'll need to have set the 'Separate stock for choices' option for the product itself to set stock values for each variant option.
