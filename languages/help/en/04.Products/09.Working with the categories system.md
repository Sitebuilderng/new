# Working with the categories system

The Products feature has a built-in categories system which is designed to help you organise your products for administration purposes. The categories you add in the system are not displayed to your customer. If you want to display your products in categories to your customers you can setup pages and subpages using the Webpages system and add products to your pages. 

To work with Product categories within the CMS (Content Management System), click Products from the Welcome Screen. Click the menu under Categories and then click 'Manage Categories'. You can then click 'New product category' to create a new category. You can use the arrow icon to the right of a category to add a sub-level category. 

Once you have your categories created, you can apply them to products by highlighting your products and then clicking the items in the Category menu. 

You can then use the Filter menu to quickly refine the products based on your selected category. This makes it very easy to work with long lists of products.
