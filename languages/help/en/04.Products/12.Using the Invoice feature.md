# Using the invoice feature

If your business requires an invoice to be generated for each sale, you can set up a special invoice page in your website. This allows your customers to receive a link to their invoice when they are sent their 'order received' or 'order dispatched' email. 

## Designing your invoice template

Invoice templates start off life as normal webpages. First, create a new webpage in [Welcome Screen](#/popup/welcome-screen) > [Webpages](#webpages-overview). Then, make it Online and tick the 'Exclude from menus' checkbox. This stops the page showing in your website's menu. 

Next, edit the page and add all the required elements of your invoice to your page. Then, click Insert > Widgets and drag the Invoice widget into the [Canvas](#/popup/canvas). Click Publish to save the changes to the live page. 

## Configuring the order received/dispatched templates

For your customers to see their invoice link, you need to add a special shortcode to your 'order received' and/or 'order dispatched' template. You can edit these templates in [Welcome Screen](#/popup/welcome-screen) > Website Settings > Checkout orders > 'Order received' template. [Learn more about the shotcodes you can add to your templates here](#configure-shop-and-product-settings). To include the invoice link for your customer make sure you add the {INVOICE_LINK} shortcode to the body of your template.
