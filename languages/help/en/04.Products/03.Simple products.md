# Working with the 'Simple product' product type

'Simple products' are easy to setup and add to your site. The basically consist of a single price and just show as a single 'add to basket' button when you add them to your page. 

To add a 'Simple product', you can click 'Products' from the Welcome Screen, then click Insert, type a name for your product and then hit enter to add it. The product price will be 'Simple product' by default. You can then specify the price of your product by clicking the 'price' option in the toolbar.
