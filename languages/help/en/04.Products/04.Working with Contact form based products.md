# Working with Contact form based products

Contact form based products are a good way to allow your customers to add detailed custom information with their order. Using the contact form system, you can create a form that your customers need to fill in when they add the product to their basket. Learn more about the kinds of fields you can add to [contact forms here](#working-with-contact-forms).

- To create a contact form based product you need to first create the contact form as you normally would.
- Next, create the product. Click Products from the Welcome Screen and then click 'Add product', type a name for the product and then hit enter to confirm. 
- Next, click the menu item under 'Type' then 'Contact form based product' and then click the form your created initially to attach it to your product. 
- You can then click the Price option to set the price for your product. 

When you're ready to add it to your page, you can edit the page, then click 'Insert' and then 'Products' and then drag your product to your page.
