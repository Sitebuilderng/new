# Adding per-product shipping costs

You can specify a shipping amount per product. This will be displayed as a single item for the whole basket on the checkout page. The customer won't be aware of how much the shipping charge is for individual items, they'll just see a combined figure for all items in their basket. 

You can also add volume discounts to the shipping amount in the same way as with normal product pricing. Simply click the 'Add volume discount' button below the shipping price field to add a new price and a threshold.

The threshold behaviour differs slightly from product volume discounts in that the price for each threshold remains fixed for the eligible quantities. For example, let's say you specify a normal shipping rate of $5 for an item and then you offer a $1 shipping rate with a threshold of 10 items or more. If someone added 12 items to their basket, the first 9 items would each have the shipping cost of $5 each, then items 10-12 would each have the $1 shipping rate for a total shipping charge of $48.
