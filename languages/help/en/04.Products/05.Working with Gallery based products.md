# Working with Gallery based products

You can combine an image gallery with a product to let your customer choose an image to customize their product when they add it to their basket. This is useful for selling things like photo prints or clothing.

- To set this up, first [add an image gallery in the normal way](#working-with-images-and-galleries). 
- Then, click Products from the Welcome Screen and click 'Add product', type a name for the product and hit enter to add it. 
- Next, click the menu item under 'Type' and choose 'Gallery based product'. Then choose the gallery you created initially. 
- You can now click the Price item to choose a price for the product.

When you're ready to add it to your page, you can edit the page, then click 'Insert' and then 'Products' and then drag your product to your page.
