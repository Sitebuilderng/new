# Working with Donation products

Donation products basically behave in the same way as Simple products except the customer can choose how much they want to pay. 

To add a 'Donation product', you can click 'Products' from the Welcome Screen, then click Insert, type a name for your product and then hit enter to add it. Then click the menu under 'Type' and choose 'Donation'. You can then specify the default price of your product by clicking the 'price' option in the toolbar - but remember the customer can override this themselves. 

When you're ready to add the product to your page, edit your page, then click Insert > Products then drag your product onto the Canvas.
