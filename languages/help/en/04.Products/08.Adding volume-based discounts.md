# Adding volume-based discounts

You can reduce the unit-price of products if the customer adds increasing quantities of the item to their basket. 

To set this up, add a product as normal, then click the 'Add volume discount' button. You can then add the first discount by specifying a price and threshold. 

The threshold is the quantity of the product over which the new price will be charged. 

Important: The price per item will apply to all units once the quantity is equal to or over the threshold for a given price. 

For example, if a product's normal price is $10, and you add a volume discount for 4 or more of the item, with the price of $5. If someone adds 3 of the product to their basket, the price per item would be $10, totalling $30. However, if they add 4 of the item to their basket, then the price for each one would drop to $5, totalling $20.

You can add three levels of discount by clicking the 'Add volume discount' button again to add a new threshold and price.
