# Products overview

You can create products of many different types. You can add any product to any page on your website. You can build your product pages using the full suite of [layout tools](#layout-overview) - you don't need to follow a template for your product pages.

To start selling products on your website, you need to setup a checkout page by [adding the Checkout widget to a page](#using-the-checkout-widget) as well as [configure the checkout and shop settings](#configure-shop-and-product-settings) by going to Website Settings > Checkout orders.

Once you have set up your website by setting the settings and adding a Checkout widget to your site, you can start creating your product pages. Product pages are like any other kind of page on your website. You can add pictures, text and any other layout items to your page as normal. Then, when you want to show the 'add to basket' button on your page you can click Insert > Products and drag your product onto the page. The location you add your product to is where the 'add to basket' button will show. 

Once someone clicks the 'add to basket' button they will be redirected to the checkout page where they can complete their order.
